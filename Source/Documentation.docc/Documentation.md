# Polywrap Client Documentation

Welcome to the Polywrap Client documentation. This documentation provides a detailed overview of the functionality and usage of the Polywrap Client library.


This package allows interaction with the Polywrap Protocol. It is a Swift implementation of a [Polywrap Client](https://docs.polywrap.io/clients)

## Installation

PolywrapClient is available through Swift Package Manager. To install it into a project, add it as a dependency within your Package.swift manifest:

```swift
let package = Package(
    ...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/polywrap/swift-client.git", from: "0.0.3")
    ],
    ...
)
```

Then import PolywrapClient wherever youâ€™d like to use it:

```swift
import PolywrapClient
```
    
## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to create a Config Builder instance which will allow you to configure the PolywrapClient instance. Then you can just call the `build` method of the `BuilderConfig` and get and instance of the client.

Once you have the instance of the client, you can invoke any WRAP by passing the URI and the method name. Optionally, you can also provide args and environment variables.

```swift
import PolywrapClient

// Create a Config Builder instance
let builder = BuilderConfig()

// Create a PolywrapClient instance with the builder
let client = builder.build()

// Invoke any method by passing URI and method name
let result: String = try client.invoke(uri: "wrap/some-uri", method: "someMethod")

// Or if you'd like to pass args and environment variables
let result: String = try client.invoke(uri: "wrap/some-uri", method: "anotherMethod", args: someCodableStructInstance, env: anotherCodableStructInstace)

```
